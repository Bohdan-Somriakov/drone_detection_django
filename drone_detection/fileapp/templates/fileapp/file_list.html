                    <p>
                        OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that provides a vast collection of algorithms and tools
                        for computer vision tasks. OpenCV is primarily used for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. It allows users
                        to work with images, video, and 3D data in a highly efficient manner. OpenCV supports a wide range of functionalities, such as
                        image recognition, object detection, face recognition, motion analysis, and more. It is implemented in C++ but offers bindings
                        for Python, Java, and other programming languages. OpenCV is widely used in real-time systems and embedded applications, such
                        as robotics, medical imaging, and surveillance. The library is designed to run efficiently even on low-resource devices, making
                        it ideal for applications where performance is crucial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OpenCV also provides tools for motion tracking and image stitching, which are used in technologies like augmented reality (AR)
                        and virtual reality (VR). With OpenCV, developers can easily apply various image transformation techniques, such as rotation,
                        scaling, and image warping. The library supports a wide range of formats and input devices, including cameras, video files,
                        and live video streams. Additionally, OpenCV supports machine learning algorithms, which are utilized for classification,
                        regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction tasks. The library integrates well with other deep learning frameworks like
                        TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, enabling users to build end-to-end computer vision and machine learning pipelines.

                    <p>
                        TensorFlow is a comprehensive open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a variety of tools,
                        libraries, and resources for developing machine learning models, specifically deep learning models. TensorFlow allows developers
                        to easily create neural networks, train them using large datasets, and deploy them for a variety of applications. TensorFlow
                        supports both CPU and GPU acceleration, making it highly scalable for both small and large-scale machine learning projects.
                        TensorFlow includes tools such as TensorFlow Lite (for mobile and embedded devices), TensorFlow.js (for machine learning in the
                        browser), and TensorFlow Extended (for end-to-end machine learning pipelines). TensorFlow is particularly popular in applications
                        such as natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. It is widely
                        used in academia and industry for its flexibility and performance. TensorFlowâ€™s user-friendly high-level API, Keras, is widely
                        used by developers to build machine learning models with ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most powerful features of TensorFlow is its ability to scale and run models on different hardware architectures,
                        from edge devices like smartphones to large-scale distributed systems using clusters of GPUs. TensorFlow also supports both
                        supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms, providing a rich set of algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression,
                        and anomaly detection. The TensorFlow ecosystem includes powerful visualization tools, such as TensorBoard, which allow users
                        to monitor and debug the training process in real-time. TensorFlow's model optimization tools, such as pruning and quantization,
                        help developers deploy efficient models to production environments with reduced latency and lower resource consumption.
                        TensorFlow is widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where cutting-edge AI solutions
                        are essential for driving innovation.
